Model status
=============

The current CellML model implementation runs in OpenCOR_.
The CellML model parameters and equations must be updated regarding each specific simulations to reproduce the related results.
In some cases, the results have been validated against the data extracted from the figures in the published `: Tong W-C, et al (2011)`.
Using the default parameters provided in the paper, except figure 13.

Model Summary
==============
Uterine contractions during labor are discretely regulated by rhythmic action potentials (AP) of varying duration and forms
that determine calcium-dependent force production. The authors employed a computational biology approach to
develop a mathematical platform of biophysical detail to describe known uterine excitation-contraction coupling mechanisms.
